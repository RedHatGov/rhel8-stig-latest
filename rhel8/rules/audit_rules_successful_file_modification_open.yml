description: 'At a minimum, the audit system should collect unauthorized file

  accesses for all users and root. If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured

  to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon

  startup (the default), add the following lines to a file with suffix

  <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:


  <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S open -F success=1 -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
  -F key=successful-access</pre>


  If the system is 64 bit then also add the following lines:

  <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S open -F success=1 -F auid&gt;=1000 -F auid!=unset
  -F key=successful-access</pre>


  If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

  utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to
