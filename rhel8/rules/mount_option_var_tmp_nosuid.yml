description: 'The <tt>nosuid</tt> mount option can be used to prevent

  execution of setuid programs in <tt>/var/tmp</tt>. The SUID and SGID permissions

  should not be required in these world-writable directories.

  Add the <code>nosuid</code> option to the fourth column of

  <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> for the line which controls mounting of

  <code>/var/tmp</code>.'
