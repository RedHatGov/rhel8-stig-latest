description: 'The audit system should collect write events to /etc/passwd file for
  all users and root.

  If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured

  to use the <tt>augenrules</tt> program to read audit rules during daemon

  startup (the default), add the following lines to a file with suffix

  <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>:

  <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S openat -F a2&amp;03 -F path=/etc/passwd -F auid>=1000
  -F auid!=unset -F key=modify</pre>

  If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

  utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the following lines to

  <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file:

  <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S openat -F a2&amp;03 -F path=/etc/passwd -F auid>=1000
  -F auid!=unset -F key=modify</pre>

  If the system is 64 bit then also add the following line:

  <pre>-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S openat -F a2&amp;03 -F path=/etc/passwd -F auid>=1000
  -F auid!=unset -F key=modify</pre>'

ocil: 'To determine if the system is configured to audit calls to the

  <code>openat</code> system call, run the following command:

  <pre space="preserve">$ sudo grep "openat" /etc/audit/audit.*</pre>

  If the system is configured to audit this activity, it will return a line.

  Auditing these events could serve as evidence of potential system compromise.'
