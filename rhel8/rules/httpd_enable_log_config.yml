rationale: 'A major tool in exploring the web site use, attempted use, unusual conditions,

  and problems are reported in the access and error logs. In the event of a

  security incident, these logs can provide the SA and the web manager with

  valuable information. Without these log files, SAs and web managers are

  seriously hindered in their efforts to respond appropriately to suspicious or

  criminal actions targeted at the web site.'
