rationale: 'If both the primary and secondary nameserver are under your control,

  or if you have only one nameserver, it may be possible to use an external

  configuration management mechanism to distribute zone updates. In that case, it

  is not necessary to allow zone transfers within BIND itself, so they should be

  disabled to avoid the potential for abuse.'
