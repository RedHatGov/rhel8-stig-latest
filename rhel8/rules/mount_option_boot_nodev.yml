description: 'The <tt>nodev</tt> mount option can be used to prevent device files
  from

  being created in <tt>/boot</tt>.

  Legitimate character and block devices should exist only in

  jails built for system services.

  Add the <code>nodev</code> option to the fourth column of

  <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> for the line which controls mounting of

  <code>/boot</code>.'
