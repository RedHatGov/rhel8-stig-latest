description: 'The INFO parameter specifices that record login and logout activity
  will be logged.

  To specify the log level in

  SSH, add or correct the following line in the <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> file:

  <pre>LogLevel INFO</pre>'
identifiers: {cce: 82282-5}
ocil: 'To check if LogLevel is enabled or set correctly, run the

  following command:

  <pre>$ sudo grep "^LogLevel" /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>

  If configured properly, output should be <pre>LogLevel INFO</pre>'
ocil_clause: it is commented out or is not enabled

platform: machine
prodtype: all
rationale: 'SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity.
  <tt>DEBUG</tt> is specifically

  not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides

  so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information. <tt>INFO</tt>
  level is the

  basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such
  as Incident

  Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system.
  The

  logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the
  field.'
