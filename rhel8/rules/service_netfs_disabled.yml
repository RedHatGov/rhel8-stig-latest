description: 'The netfs script manages the boot-time mounting of several types

  of networked filesystems, of which NFS and Samba are the most common. If these

  filesystem types are not in use, the script can be disabled, protecting the

  system somewhat against accidental or malicious changes to <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>

  and against flaws in the netfs script itself.


  The <code>netfs</code> service can be disabled with the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo systemctl disable netfs.service</pre>

  The <code>netfs</code> service can be masked with the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo systemctl mask netfs.service</pre>'
