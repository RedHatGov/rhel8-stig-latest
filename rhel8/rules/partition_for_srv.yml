description: 'If a file server (FTP, TFTP...) is hosted locally, create a separate
  partition

  for <tt>/srv</tt> at installation time (or migrate it later using LVM). If

  <tt>/srv</tt> will be mounted from another system such as an NFS server, then

  creating a separate partition is not necessary at installation time, and the

  mountpoint can instead be configured later.'

ocil: 'Run the following command to determine if <code>/srv</code>

  is on its own partition or logical volume:

  <pre>$ mount | grep "on /srv"</pre>

  If <code>/srv</code> has its own partition or volume group, a line will be returned.

rationale: 'Srv deserves files for local network file server such as FTP. Ensuring

  that <tt>/srv</tt> is mounted on its own partition enables the setting of

  more restrictive mount options, and also helps ensure that

  users cannot trivially fill partitions used for log or audit data storage.'
