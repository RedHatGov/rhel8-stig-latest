description: 'Compression is useful for slow network connections over long

  distances but can cause performance issues on local LANs. If use of compression

  is required, it should be enabled only after a user has authenticated; otherwise

  , it should be disabled. To disable compression or delay compression until after

  a user has successfully authenticated, add or correct the following line in the

  <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> file:

  <pre>Compression <sub idref="var_sshd_disable_compression"/></pre>'
identifiers: {cce: 80895-6}
ocil: 'To check if compression is enabled or set correctly, run the

  following command:

  <pre>$ sudo grep Compression /etc/ssh/sshd_config</pre>

  If configured properly, output should be <pre>no</pre> or <pre>delayed</pre>.'
ocil_clause: it is commented out, or is not set to no or delayed
oval_external_content: null
platform: machine
prodtype: all
rationale: 'If compression is allowed in an SSH connection prior to authentication,

  vulnerabilities in the compression software could result in compromise of the

  system from an unauthenticated connection, potentially wih root privileges.'
