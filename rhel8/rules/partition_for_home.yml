description: 'If user home directories will be stored locally, create a separate partition

  for <tt>/home</tt> at installation time (or migrate it later using LVM). If

  <tt>/home</tt> will be mounted from another system such as an NFS server, then

  creating a separate partition is not necessary at installation time, and the

  mountpoint can instead be configured later.'

ocil: 'Run the following command to determine if <code>/home</code>

  is on its own partition or logical volume:

  <pre>$ mount | grep "on /home"</pre>

  If <code>/home</code> has its own partition or volume group, a line will be returned.

rationale: 'Ensuring that <tt>/home</tt> is mounted on its own partition enables the

  setting of more restrictive mount options, and also helps ensure that

  users cannot trivially fill partitions used for log or audit data storage.'
