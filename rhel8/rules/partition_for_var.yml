description: 'The <tt>/var</tt> directory is used by daemons and other system

  services to store frequently-changing data. Ensure that <tt>/var</tt> has its own
  partition

  or logical volume at installation time, or migrate it using LVM.'

ocil: 'Run the following command to determine if <code>/var</code>

  is on its own partition or logical volume:

  <pre>$ mount | grep "on /var"</pre>

  If <code>/var</code> has its own partition or volume group, a line will be returned.

rationale: 'Ensuring that <tt>/var</tt> is mounted on its own partition enables the

  setting of more restrictive mount options. This helps protect

  system services such as daemons or other programs which use it.

  It is not uncommon for the <tt>/var</tt> directory to contain

  world-writable directories installed by other software packages.'
