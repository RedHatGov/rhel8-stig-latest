rationale: 'In contrast to traditional electromechanical magnetic disks, containing

  spinning disks and / or movable read / write heads, the solid-state storage

  devices (SSDs) do not contain moving / mechanical components. Therefore the

  I/O operation completion times are much more predictable for them.'
