description: 'System-wide shared library files, which are linked to executables

  during process load time or run time, are stored in the following directories

  by default:

  <pre>/lib

  /lib64

  /usr/lib

  /usr/lib64

  </pre>

  Kernel modules, which can be added to the kernel during runtime, are also

  stored in <tt>/lib/modules</tt>. All files in these directories should be

  owned by the <tt>root</tt> user. If the directory, or any file in these

  directories, is found to be owned by a user other than root correct its

  ownership with the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo chown root <i>FILE</i></pre>'
identifiers: {cce: 80807-1}
ocil: 'Shared libraries are stored in the following directories:

  <pre>/lib

  /lib64

  /usr/lib

  /usr/lib64</pre>

  For each of these directories, run the following command to find files not

  owned by root:

  <pre>$ sudo find -L <i>$DIR</i> ! -user root -exec chown root {} \;</pre>'
ocil_clause: any of these files are not owned by root

rationale: 'Files from shared library directories are loaded into the address

  space of processes (including privileged ones) or of the kernel itself at

  runtime. Proper ownership is necessary to protect the integrity of the system.'
