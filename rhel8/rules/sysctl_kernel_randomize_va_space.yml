  kernel parameter, run the following command: <pre>$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=2</pre>

ocil: 'The status of the <code>kernel.randomize_va_space</code> kernel parameter can
  be queried

  by running the following command:

  <pre>$ sysctl kernel.randomize_va_space</pre>

  The output of the command should indicate a value of <code>2</code>.

  If this value is not the default value, investigate how it could have been

  adjusted at runtime, and verify it is not set improperly. This has to be checked

  in all files in the <tt>/etc/sysctl.d</tt> directory and the deprecated

  <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code>. You can verify this by running the following command:

  <pre>$ grep -r kernel.randomize_va_space /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d</pre>

rationale: 'Address space layout randomization (ASLR) makes it more difficult for
  an

  attacker to predict the location of attack code they have introduced into a

  process''s address space during an attempt at exploitation.  Additionally,

  ASLR makes it more difficult for an attacker to know the location of

  existing code in order to re-purpose it using return oriented programming

  (ROP) techniques.'
