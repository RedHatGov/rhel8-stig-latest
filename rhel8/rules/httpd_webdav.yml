description: 'WebDAV is an extension of the HTTP protocol that provides distributed
  and

  collaborative access to web content. If its functionality is unnecessary,

  comment out the related modules:

  <pre>#LoadModule dav_module modules/mod_dav.so

  #LoadModule dav_fs_module modules/mod_dav_fs.so</pre>

  If there is a critical need for WebDAV, extra care should be taken in its configuration.

  Since DAV access allows remote clients to manipulate server files, any location
  on the

  server that is DAV enabled should be protected by access controls.'
