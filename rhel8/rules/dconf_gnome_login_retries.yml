  screen and be configured to restart the authentication process after

  a configured number of attempts. This can be configured by setting

  <tt>allowed-failures</tt> to <tt>3</tt> or less.

  To enable, add or edit <tt>allowed-failures</tt> to

  <tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/00-security-settings</tt>. For example:

  <pre>[org/gnome/login-screen]

  allowed-failures=3</pre>

  Once the setting has been added, add a lock to

  <tt>/etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/locks/00-security-settings-lock</tt> to prevent user modification.

  For example:

  <pre>/org/gnome/login-screen/allowed-failures</pre>

  After the settings have been set, run <tt>dconf update</tt>.'

  run the following command:

  To ensure that users cannot change or configure the resets after a specified

  number of failures on the login screen, run the following:

rationale: 'Setting the password retry prompts that are permitted on a per-session
  basis to a low value

  requires some software, such as SSH, to re-connect. This can slow down and

  draw additional attention to some types of password-guessing attacks.'
