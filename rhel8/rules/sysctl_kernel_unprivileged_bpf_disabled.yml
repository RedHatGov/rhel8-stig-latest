description: 'To set the runtime status of the <code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled</code>
  kernel parameter, run the following command: <pre>$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1</pre>

  If this is not the system default value, add the following line to a file in the
  directory <tt>/etc/sysctl.d</tt>: <pre>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled = 1</pre>'

ocil: 'The status of the <code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled</code> kernel parameter
  can be queried

  by running the following command:

  <pre>$ sysctl kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled</pre>

  The output of the command should indicate a value of <code>1</code>.

  If this value is not the default value, investigate how it could have been

  adjusted at runtime, and verify it is not set improperly. This has to be checked

  in all files in the <tt>/etc/sysctl.d</tt> directory and the deprecated

  <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code>. You can verify this by running the following command:

  <pre>$ grep -r kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d</pre>
