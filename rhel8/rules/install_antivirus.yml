description: 'Virus scanning software can be used to protect a system from penetration
  from

  computer viruses and to limit their spread through intermediate systems.


  The virus scanning software should be configured to perform scans dynamically

  on accessed files. If this capability is not available, the system must be

  configured to scan, at a minimum, all altered files on the system on a daily

  basis.


  If the system processes inbound SMTP mail, the virus scanner must be configured

  to scan all received mail.'
