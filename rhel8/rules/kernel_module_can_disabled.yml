description: 'The Controller Area Network (CAN) is a serial communications

  protocol which was initially developed for automotive and

  is now also used in marine, industrial, and medical applications.


  To configure the system to prevent the <code>can</code>

  kernel module from being loaded, add the following line to a file in the directory
  <code>/etc/modprobe.d</code>:

  <pre>install can /bin/true</pre>'
identifiers: {cce: 82059-7}
ocil: '

  If the system is configured to prevent the loading of the <code>can</code> kernel
  module,

  it will contain lines inside any file in <code>/etc/modprobe.d</code> or the deprecated<code>/etc/modprobe.conf</code>.

  These lines instruct the module loading system to run another program (such as <code>/bin/true</code>)
  upon a module <code>install</code> event.

  Run the following command to search for such lines in all files in <code>/etc/modprobe.d</code>
  and the deprecated <code>/etc/modprobe.conf</code>:

  <pre>$ grep -r can /etc/modprobe.conf /etc/modprobe.d</pre>'
ocil_clause: no line is returned
oval_external_content: null
platform: machine
prodtype: rhel6,rhel7,rhel8,fedora,ol8,ocp4
rationale: 'Disabling CAN protects the system against exploitation of any

  flaws in its implementation.'
