rationale: 'A core dump includes a memory image taken at the time the operating system

  terminates an application. The memory image could contain sensitive data

  and is generally useful only for developers or system operators trying to

  debug problems. Enabling core dumps on production systems is not recommended,

  however there may be overriding operational requirements to enable advanced

  debuging. Permitting temporary enablement of core dumps during such situations

  should be reviewed through local needs and policy. '
