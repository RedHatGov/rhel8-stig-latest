rationale: 'The directories containing the CGI scripts, such as PERL, must not be

  accessible to anonymous users via FTP. This applies to all directories that

  contain scripts that can dynamically produce web pages in an interactive manner

  (i.e., scripts based upon user-provided input). Such scripts contain information

  that could be used to compromise a web service, access system resources, or

  deface a web site.'
