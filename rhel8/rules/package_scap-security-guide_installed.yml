rationale: 'The <tt>scap-security-guide</tt> package provides a guide for configuration
  of the system

  from the final system''s security point of view. The guidance is specified in the
  Security

  Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) format and constitutes a catalog of practical
  hardening

  advice, linked to government requirements where applicable. The SCAP Security Guide
  project

  bridges the gap between generalized policy requirements and specific implementation
  guidelines.

  A system administrator can use the <tt>oscap</tt> CLI tool from the <tt>openscap-scanner</tt>

  package, or the SCAP Workbench GUI tool from the <tt>scap-workbench</tt> package,
  to verify

  that the system conforms to provided guidelines. Refer to the scap-security-guide(8)
  manual

  page for futher information.'
