description: 'By removing the <tt>gdm</tt> package, the system no longer has GNOME
  installed

  installed. If X Windows is not installed then the system cannot boot into graphical
  user mode.

  This prevents the system from being accidentally or maliciously booted into a <tt>graphical.target</tt>

  mode. To do so, run the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo yum remove gdm</pre>'
identifiers: {cce: 82367-4}
ocil: 'To ensure the gdm package group is removed, run the following command:

  <pre>$ rpm -qi gdm</pre>

  The output should be:

  <pre>package gdm is not installed</pre>'
