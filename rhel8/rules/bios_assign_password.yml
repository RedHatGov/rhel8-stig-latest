rationale: 'Assigning a password to the system boot firmware prevents anyone

  with physical access from configuring the system to boot

  from local media and circumvent the operating system''s access controls.

  For systems in physically secure locations, such as

  a data center or Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), this risk
  must be weighed

  against the risk of administrative personnel being unable to conduct recovery operations
  in

  a timely fashion.'
