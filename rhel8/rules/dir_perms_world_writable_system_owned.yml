description: 'All directories in local partitions which are

  world-writable should be owned by root or another

  system account.  If any world-writable directories are not

  owned by a system account, this should be investigated.

  Following this, the files should be deleted or assigned to an

  appropriate group.'

  are not owned by a system account, given the assumption that only system

  accounts have a uid lower than 500.  Run it once for each local partition <i>PART</i>:

rationale: 'Allowing a user account to own a world-writable directory is

  undesirable because it allows the owner of that directory to remove

  or replace any files that may be placed in the directory by other

  users.'
