description: 'The <tt>~/.shosts</tt> (in each user''s home directory) files

  list remote hosts and users that are trusted by the

  local system. To remove these files, run the following command

  to delete them from any location:

  <pre>$ sudo find / -name ''.shosts'' -type f -delete</pre>'

rationale: 'The .shosts files are used to configure host-based authentication for

  individual users or the system via SSH. Host-based authentication is not

  sufficient for preventing unauthorized access to the system, as it does not

  require interactive identification and authentication of a connection request,

  or for the use of two-factor authentication.'
