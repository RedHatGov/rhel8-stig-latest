  The system-level database is compiled from keyfiles in the /etc/dconf/db/ directory

rationale: 'Unlike text-based keyfiles, the binary database is impossible to check
  by OVAL.

  Therefore, in order to evaluate dconf configuration, both have to be true at the
  same time -

  configuration files have to be compliant, and the database needs to be more recent
  than those keyfiles,

  which gives confidence that it reflects them.'
