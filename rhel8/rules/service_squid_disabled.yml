description: ' The <code>squid</code> service can be disabled with the following command:
  <pre>$ sudo systemctl disable squid.service</pre> The <code>squid</code> service
  can be masked with the following command: <pre>$ sudo systemctl mask squid.service</pre>'
identifiers: {cce: 82190-0}
ocil: ' To check that the <code>squid</code> service is disabled in system boot configuration,
  run the following command: <pre>$ systemctl is-enabled <code>squid</code></pre>
  Output should indicate the <code>squid</code> service has either not been installed,
  or has been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below: <pre>$ systemctl
  is-enabled <code>squid</code><br/> disabled</pre>

  Run the following command to verify <code>squid</code> is not active (i.e. not running)
  through current runtime configuration: <pre>$ systemctl is-active squid</pre>

  If the service is not running the command will return the following output: <pre>inactive</pre>

  By default the service will also be masked, to check that the <code>squid</code>
  is masked, run the following command: <pre>$ systemctl show <code>squid</code> |
  grep "LoadState\|UnitFileState"</pre>

  If the service is masked the command will return the following outputs:

  <pre>LoadState=masked</pre>

  <pre>UnitFileState=masked</pre>'
