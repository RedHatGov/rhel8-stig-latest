description: 'To set the runtime status of the <code>fs.suid_dumpable</code> kernel
  parameter, run the following command: <pre>$ sudo sysctl -w fs.suid_dumpable=0</pre>

  If this is not the system default value, add the following line to a file in the
  directory <tt>/etc/sysctl.d</tt>: <pre>fs.suid_dumpable = 0</pre>'

ocil: 'The status of the <code>fs.suid_dumpable</code> kernel parameter can be queried

  by running the following command:

  <pre>$ sysctl fs.suid_dumpable</pre>

  The output of the command should indicate a value of <code>0</code>.

  If this value is not the default value, investigate how it could have been

  adjusted at runtime, and verify it is not set improperly. This has to be checked

  in all files in the <tt>/etc/sysctl.d</tt> directory and the deprecated

  <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code>. You can verify this by running the following command:

  <pre>$ grep -r fs.suid_dumpable /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d</pre>

rationale: 'The core dump of a setuid program is more likely to contain

  sensitive data, as the program itself runs with greater privileges than the

  user who initiated execution of the program.  Disabling the ability for any

  setuid program to write a core file decreases the risk of unauthorized access

  of such data.'
