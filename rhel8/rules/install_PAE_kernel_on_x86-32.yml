description: 'Systems that are using the 64-bit x86 kernel package

  do not need to install the kernel-PAE package because the 64-bit

  x86 kernel already includes this support. However, if the system is

  32-bit and also supports the PAE and NX features as

  determined in the previous section, the kernel-PAE package should

  be installed to enable XD or NX support.

  The <code>kernel-PAE</code> package can be installed with the following command:

  <pre>

  $ sudo yum install kernel-PAE</pre>

  The installation process should also have configured the

  bootloader to load the new kernel at boot. Verify this after reboot


  and modify <tt>/etc/default/grub</tt> if necessary.'
