rationale: 'A symbolic link allows a file or a directory to be referenced using a
  symbolic

  name raising a potential hazard if symbolic linkage is made to a sensitive area.

  When web scripts are executed and symbolic links are allowed, the web user could

  be allowed to access locations on the web server that are outside the scope of

  the web document root or home directory.'
