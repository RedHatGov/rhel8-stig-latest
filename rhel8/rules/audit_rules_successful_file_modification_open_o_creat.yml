description: 'The <tt>open</tt> syscall can be used to create new files

  when O_CREAT flag is specified.


  The following audit rules will assure that successful attempts to create a

  file via <tt>open</tt> syscall are collected.


  If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>augenrules</tt>

  program to read audit rules during daemon startup (the default), add the

  rules below to a file with suffix <tt>.rules</tt> in the directory

  <tt>/etc/audit/rules.d</tt>.


  If the <tt>auditd</tt> daemon is configured to use the <tt>auditctl</tt>

  utility to read audit rules during daemon startup, add the rules below to

  <tt>/etc/audit/audit.rules</tt> file.


  <pre>

  -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S open -F a2&amp;0100 -F success=1 -F auid>=1000 -F
  auid!=unset -F key=successful-create

  </pre>


  If the system is 64 bit then also add the following lines:

  <pre>

  -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S open -F a2&amp;0100 -F success=1 -F auid>=1000 -F
  auid!=unset -F key=successful-create

  </pre>'

  to the <code>open</code> system call, run the following command:

    number of ways while still achieving the desired effect. Here the system calls

    have been placed independent of other system calls. Grouping system calls related

    to the same event is more efficient. See the following example:
