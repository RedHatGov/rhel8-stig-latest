  path statements do not contain statements that will reference a working

  directory other than the users home directory, run the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo grep -r PATH /home/</pre>

  Inspect the output for any PATH is references directories outside the home directory.'

rationale: 'The executable search path (typically the PATH environment variable) contains
  a

  list of directories for the shell to search to find executables. If this path

  includes the current working directory (other than the users home directory),

  executables in these directories may be executed instead of system commands.

  This variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories. If there is

  an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon or two consecutive colons,

  this is interpreted as the current working directory. If deviations from the

  default system search path for the local interactive user are required, they

  must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO).'
