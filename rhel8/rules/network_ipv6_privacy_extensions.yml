description: 'To introduce randomness into the automatic generation of IPv6

  addresses, add or correct the following line in

  <tt>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<i>interface</i></tt>:

  <pre>IPV6_PRIVACY=rfc3041</pre>

  Automatically-generated IPv6 addresses are based on the underlying hardware

  (e.g. Ethernet) address, and so it becomes possible to track a piece of

  hardware over its lifetime using its traffic. If it is important for a system''s

  IP address to not trivially reveal its hardware address, this setting should be

  applied.'
