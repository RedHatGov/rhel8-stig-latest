description: ' The <code>smb</code> service can be disabled with the following command:
  <pre>$ sudo systemctl disable smb.service</pre> The <code>smb</code> service can
  be masked with the following command: <pre>$ sudo systemctl mask smb.service</pre>'
identifiers: {}
ocil: ' To check that the <code>smb</code> service is disabled in system boot configuration,
  run the following command: <pre>$ systemctl is-enabled <code>smb</code></pre> Output
  should indicate the <code>smb</code> service has either not been installed, or has
  been disabled at all runlevels, as shown in the example below: <pre>$ systemctl
  is-enabled <code>smb</code><br/> disabled</pre>

  Run the following command to verify <code>smb</code> is not active (i.e. not running)
  through current runtime configuration: <pre>$ systemctl is-active smb</pre>

  If the service is not running the command will return the following output: <pre>inactive</pre>

  By default the service will also be masked, to check that the <code>smb</code> is
  masked, run the following command: <pre>$ systemctl show <code>smb</code> | grep
  "LoadState\|UnitFileState"</pre>

  If the service is masked the command will return the following outputs:

  <pre>LoadState=masked</pre>

  <pre>UnitFileState=masked</pre>'
