description: 'The <tt>gpgcheck</tt> option controls whether

  RPM packages'' signatures are always checked prior to installation.

  To configure yum to check package signatures before installing

  them, ensure the following line appears in <tt>/etc/yum.conf</tt> in

  the <tt>[main]</tt> section:

  <pre>gpgcheck=1</pre>'
identifiers: {cce: 80790-9}
ocil: 'To determine whether <tt>yum</tt> is configured to use <tt>gpgcheck</tt>,

  inspect <tt>/etc/yum.conf</tt> and ensure the following appears in the

  <tt>[main]</tt> section:

  <pre>gpgcheck=1</pre>

  A value of <tt>1</tt> indicates that <tt>gpgcheck</tt> is enabled. Absence of a

  <tt>gpgcheck</tt> line or a setting of <tt>0</tt> indicates that it is

  disabled.'

rationale: 'Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the

  overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the

  software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a

  trusted vendor.

  <br />

  Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system

  components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the

  organization.

  <br />Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation

  validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor.

  This ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been

  provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by

  this requirement. Certificates used to verify the software must be from an

  approved Certificate Authority (CA).'
