description: 'Crypto Policies provide a centralized control over crypto algorithms
  usage of many packages.

  Libreswan is supported by system crypto policy, but the Libreswan configuration
  may be

  set up to ignore it.


  To check that Crypto Policies settings are configured correctly, ensure that the
  <tt>/etc/ipsec.conf</tt>

  includes the appropriate configuration file.

  In <tt>/etc/ipsec.conf</tt>, make sure that the following line

  is not commented out or superseded by later includes:

  <tt>include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config</tt>'
identifiers: {cce: 80937-6}
ocil: 'To verify that Libreswan uses the system crypto policy, run the following command:

  <pre>$ grep include /etc/ipsec.conf</pre>

  The output should return something similar to:

  <pre>include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config</pre>'
ocil_clause: Libreswan is installed and <tt>/etc/ipsec.conf</tt> does not contain
  <tt>include /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/libreswan.config</tt>

rationale: 'Overriding the system crypto policy makes the behavior of the Libreswan

  service violate expectations, and makes system configuration more

  fragmented.'
