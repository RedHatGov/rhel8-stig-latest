description: 'The rpcbind utility maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen.

  RPC processes notify rpcbind when they start, registering the ports they

  are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve. The

  rpcbind service redirects the client to the proper port number so it can

  communicate with the requested service. If the system does not require RPC

  (such as for NFS servers) then this service should be disabled.


  The <code>rpcbind</code> service can be disabled with the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo systemctl disable rpcbind.service</pre>

  The <code>rpcbind</code> service can be masked with the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo systemctl mask rpcbind.service</pre>'
