description: 'Configure non-compliant accounts to enforce a 60-day maximum password
  lifetime

  restriction by running the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo chage -M 60 <i>USER</i></pre>'
identifiers: {cce: 82473-0}
ocil: 'Check whether the maximum time period for existing passwords is restricted

  to 60 days by running the following command for each user:

  <pre>$ sudo chage -l <i>USER</i> | grep Maximum</pre>

  The output for each user should return something similary to the following:

  <pre>Maximum number of days between password change\t\t: 60</pre>'

rationale: 'Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked. Therefore,

  passwords need to be changed periodically. If the operating system does

  not limit the lifetime of passwords and force users to change their

  passwords, there is the risk that the operating system passwords could be

  compromised.'
