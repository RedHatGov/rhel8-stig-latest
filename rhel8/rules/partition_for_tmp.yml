ocil: 'Run the following command to determine if <code>/tmp</code>

  is on its own partition or logical volume:

  <pre>$ mount | grep "on /tmp"</pre>

  If <code>/tmp</code> has its own partition or volume group, a line will be returned.

rationale: 'The <tt>/tmp</tt> partition is used as temporary storage by many programs.

  Placing <tt>/tmp</tt> in its own partition enables the setting of more

  restrictive mount options, which can help protect programs which use it.'
