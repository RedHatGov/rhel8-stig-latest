description: 'By default, inbound connections to SSH''s port are allowed. If the SSH

  server is not being used, this exception should be removed from the

  firewall configuration.

  <br /><br />

  Edit the files <tt>/etc/sysconfig/iptables</tt> and

  <tt>/etc/sysconfig/ip6tables</tt> (if IPv6 is in use). In each file, locate

  and delete the line:

  <pre>-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT</pre>

  This is unusual, as SSH is a common method for encrypted and authenticated

  remote access.'
