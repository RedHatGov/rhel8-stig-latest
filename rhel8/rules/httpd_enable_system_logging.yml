rationale: 'The server error logs are invaluable because they can also be used to
  identify

  potential problems and enable proactive remediation. Log data can reveal

  anomalous behavior such as "not found" or "unauthorized" errors that may

  be an evidence of attack attempts. Failure to enable error logging can

  significantly reduce the ability of Web Administrators to detect or remediate

  problems. The CustomLog directive specifies the log file, syslog facility, or

  piped logging utility.'
