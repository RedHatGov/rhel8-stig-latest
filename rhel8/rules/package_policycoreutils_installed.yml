rationale: "Security-enhanced Linux is a feature of the Linux kernel and a number\
  \ of utilities\nwith enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access\
  \ controls to Linux.\nThe Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new architectural\
  \ components originally\ndeveloped to improve security of the Flask operating system.\
  \ These architectural components\nprovide general support for the enforcement of\
  \ many kinds of mandatory access control\npolicies, including those based on the\
  \ concepts of Type Enforcement, Role-based Access\nControl, and Multi-level Security.\
  \ \n\n<tt>policycoreutils</tt> contains the policy core utilities that are required\
  \ for\nbasic operation of an SELinux-enabled system. These utilities include <tt>load_policy</tt>\n\
  to load SELinux policies, <tt>setfiles</tt> to label filesystems, <tt>newrole</tt>\
  \ to\nswitch roles, and <tt>run_init</tt> to run <tt>/etc/init.d</tt> scripts in\
