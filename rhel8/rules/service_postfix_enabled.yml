description: 'The Postfix mail transfer agent is used for local mail delivery

  within the system. The default configuration only listens for connections to

  the default SMTP port (port 25) on the loopback interface (127.0.0.1).  It is

  recommended to leave this service enabled for local mail delivery.


  The <code>postfix</code> service can be enabled with the following command:

  <pre>$ sudo systemctl enable postfix.service</pre>'
identifiers: {}
ocil: ' Run the following command to determine the current status of the <code>postfix</code>
  service: <pre>$ systemctl is-active postfix</pre> If the service is running, it
  should return the following: <pre>active</pre>'
ocil_clause: the system is not a cross domain solution and the service is not enabled
