Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.

For manual installations, select the Encrypt checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.

For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the --encrypted and --passphrase= options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=PASSPHRASE
Any PASSPHRASE is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the --passphrase= option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.

By default, the Anaconda installer uses aes-xts-plain64 cipher
with a minimum 512 bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.

A group authenticator is a generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a group authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users. Examples of the group authenticator is the UNIX OS ""root"" user account, the Windows ""Administrator"" account, the ""sa"" account, or a ""helpdesk"" account.

For example, the UNIX and Windows operating systems offer a 'switch user' capability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, 'switch' to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a group authenticator.

Users (and any processes acting on behalf of users) need to be uniquely identified and authenticated for all accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented by the organization, which outlines specific user actions that can be performed on the operating system without identification or authentication.

Requiring individuals to be authenticated with an individual authenticator prior to using a group authenticator allows for traceability of actions, as well as adding an additional level of protection of the actions that can be taken with group account knowledge.","The root user should never be allowed to login to a

This requirement addresses protection of user-generated data, as well as operating system-specific configuration data. Organizations may choose to employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, as appropriate, in accordance with the security category and/or classification of the information.","Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 natively supports partition encryption through the
Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) technology. The easiest way to
encrypt a partition is during installation time.

For manual installations, select the Encrypt checkbox during
partition creation to encrypt the partition. When this
option is selected the system will prompt for a passphrase to use in
decrypting the partition. The passphrase will subsequently need to be entered manually
every time the system boots.

For automated/unattended installations, it is possible to use Kickstart by adding
the --encrypted and --passphrase= options to the definition of each partition to be
encrypted. For example, the following line would encrypt the root partition:
part / --fstype=ext4 --size=100 --onpart=hda1 --encrypted --passphrase=PASSPHRASE
Any PASSPHRASE is stored in the Kickstart in plaintext, and the Kickstart
must then be protected accordingly.
Omitting the --passphrase= option from the partition definition will cause the
installer to pause and interactively ask for the passphrase during installation.

By default, the Anaconda installer uses aes-xts-plain64 cipher
with a minimum 512 bit key size which should be compatible with FIPS enabled.

Detailed information on encrypting partitions using LUKS or LUKS ciphers can be found on
